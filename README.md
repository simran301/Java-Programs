# Java-Programs
This file include all the Java Programs from basic to advance covering all the topics which are needful to become an expert JAVA DEVELOPER

---------------------KEY POINTS:------------------ 

Golden rule- Use smallest amount of memoryas possible
8 Bits = 1 Byte

Java is platform-independent as java code is executed on multiple platforms i.e. Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)

HISTORY:=>   1990 - started working on it 
             1992 - comeup with the new modified language & named as OAK on the name of tree
             1993 - Later on it was named as JAVA from the name of coffee because OAK was already a trademark by oak technologies & JAVA name was given on the name of
                       coffee that's why the logo of java is cup of coffee
            May 1995 - launched Java as free & open source

JAVA was orignally developed by JAMES GOSLING at SUN MICROSYSTEM. Official symbol of JAVA is a "coffee cup" or say a cup of coffee, but official MASCOT of Java is "DUKE" every event of JAVA is having this mascot.
In 1995, at the time of revolution java has developed applets.

Tools used for Java:- Java Developement Kit (JDK), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java Runtime Environment(JRE)

In Java, we need to write all our code in a class. Syntax:- public class classname
                                                            {
                                                              //code
                                                            }
Here there are 2 parts to a class:- 1. class keyword
                                    2. classname
                                    
Our java classname should be same as our filename. The main() method in Java is the entry point of the java application. In System.out.println(); code, println() is a function which prints a message to the console, in parenthesis we write the message that we want to print, semi-colon means end of statement& it is very important to put semi-colon. if we forget to put semi-colon then our code will not run i.e. it will throw an error.

There are 2 commands we need to run our code/application:- 1) javac - command use to compile the code => javac <filename>.java
                                                           2) java -  command use to run the compiled code => java <filename>
